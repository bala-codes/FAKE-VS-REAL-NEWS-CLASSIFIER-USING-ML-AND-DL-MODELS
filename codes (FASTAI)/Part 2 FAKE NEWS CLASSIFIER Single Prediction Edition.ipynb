            "Diwali festivities were in full swing in B-town with the who’s who showing up at Amitabh Bachchan’s bungalow for his Diwali party. Actor-Director Karan Johar who is a close friend of the family, was also seen immersed in the festivities.  karan-johar  While speaking to media camped outside Jalsa, Karan said that he was pleased to spend Diwali evening with Bollywood fraternity as he got a chance to meet all star-kids in one place, which made his task of casting them in his movies much easier.  Though not the one to mix business and pleasure, Karan was seen mingling with bollywood stars, especially star-kids to find out if they’d be interested being part of his future projects.  Sources say that Karan was the first to arrive and the last to leave, making full use of the time he spent there. “He was just too happy to have found all star kids in once place. He spent around  5 hours interacting with star-kids and even took notes. It was sort of a mini-audition,” revealed the source.  Apparently, Karan has already made plans for the next installment of SOTY and the franchise is expected to reach it’s 20th offering in another 5 years. A feat which even Apple cannot boast of with its iPhone models.  One Bollywood celebrity who was present at the party said, “Karan was particularly interested in Taimur and was speaking to Saif and Kareena at length. He was also having animated discussions with Shahid and Mira. There are not enough star-kids int he industry as the number of movies that Karan has planned for them.”  “These parties are also important as they help to identify genuine star kids. Not many know about this but Karan got scammed by a man from UP who got selected in auditions after he faked his last name as Kapoor,” the celeb added.\n",
